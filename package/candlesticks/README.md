### Candle

[Candle] class contains six required variables that hold a single candle data: date, high, low, open, close and volume.

```dart
final candle =  Candle(date: DateTime.now(), open: 1780.36, high: 1873.93, low: 1755.34, close: 1848.56, volume: 0);
```

### Candlesticks

[Candlesticks] widget requires a list of candles, the arrangement of the `candles` array should be such that the newest item is in position 0, `onLoadMoreCandles` is a nullable callback which calls whenever the last candle gets visible. and in case you whant to add more actions in top toolbar like [Binance Candles](https://rmzy.dev/candlesticks/), you can make your custom [ToolBarAction] and add it to `actions` parameter.
